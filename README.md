# My Personal Project

## A subtitle

I want to make an investment portfolio software that allows users to track investments they make in the form of bonds, stocks, etc., as well as provide summary statistics for all the investments they have. Users will be able to delete and filter investments. This software can be used by small-time investors who may not wish to commit to professional managers or softwares that may be too expensive. The main goal is convenience.

This project is of interest to me, because I want to pursue a career in the high tech financial industry. By putting together this project and researching and learning as I go, I hope to learn more about portfolio management softwares.
